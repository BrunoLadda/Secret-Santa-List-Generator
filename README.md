# Secret Santa List Generator
Developed in VueJs using Vuex
Axios for user API query
As it is a knowledge assessment (including CSS and HTML), it was decided not to use any design framework like Vuetify or Vue Material.

Application rules
- The list can only be generated if we have at least 3 participants.
- Each user must receive and give 1 gift.
- An user cannot give gift for himself
- Every time you add or remove a participant, we delete the Secret Santa list, so it can be recreated.

# Secret Santa List Generator
- Developed in VueJs using Vuex.
- Axios for user API query.
- As it is a knowledge assessment (including CSS and HTML), it was decided not to use any design framework like Vuetify or Vue Material, neither ready components.


Application rules
- The list can only be generated if we have at least 3 participants.
- Each participant must receive and give one gift.
- An participant cannot give gift for himself
- Every time you add or remove a participant, we delete the Secret Santa list, so it can be recreated.
